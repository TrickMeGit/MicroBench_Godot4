# MicroBench_Godot
Godot project to test and compare the speed of two functions/implementations.

Usage:
Insert your instructions / function calls in the script, compile the project and run it outside the editor.
If you run the project in the editor, it will run in debug mode, which can cause a false benchmark result.
